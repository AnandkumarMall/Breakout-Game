# Breakout-Game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic arcade game Breakout, using the Python turtle graphics library. The game involves a player-controlled paddle, a bouncing ball, and a series of tiles to be broken by the ball. The player moves the paddle left and right to keep the ball in play and break all the tiles to win the game.
